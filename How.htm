    <u><font color="#FFFFFF">DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT</font></u></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
    <font color="#FFFFFF">In the original plan I stated that I wanted to have 
    the functional requirements done within the first week. I think this was 
    reasonable given that I knew what I wanted to do but had not banked on 
    myself having such a hard time controlling myself and concentrating on what 
    I had to do for my project. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">When I had eventually done the 
    functional requirement it was a matter of writing down how I wanted my 
    system to operate, making my class diagram was important not to get it 
    wrong. So I ended up spending more time on this than I thought I would have.
    </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Looking back I think it was 
    unrealistic to think that I would have in place a comprehensive list of 
    functional requirements and a class diagram within a week of starting term 
    after the plan was due in. Although this was unrealistic and I didn’t manage 
    to keep to it I feel that if I had stuck with it I may have made mistakes 
    within the details of these two important documents.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">My aim was to then move on to the 
    programming, although I had already moved onto this by this time. This was 
    due to the scale of the project that I felt I had under taken. I thought it 
    would take me longer than I had originally given myself, so I decided to 
    start earlier. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The research into different Java 
    methods that I would need was to take longer than I expected as well. My 
    original plan didn’t include any specific research into Java, it simply said 
    to start the prototype. This was probably a little arrogant in thinking that 
    I already had all of the Java knowledge that I needed in order to complete 
    the prototype. I spent a fair bit of time researching Java sound utilities 
    and a lot of time researching theory behind the animations that I was going 
    to try and implement. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">I dedicated a lot of time to the 
    prototype originally, as I thought it would take longer than it did. I 
    originally thought that I would need a function prototype, but simply found 
    some code that was included in the Java package that is included in the 
    examples for Java. This was called Animator.java. It included the facilities 
    to use a set of images included in the HTML code used to run the applet, and 
    would play a sound at a set frame giving all I needed with small amendments 
    to make a working prototype. Once this was complete I decided to completely 
    deviate from this prototype and start the working model using all my own 
    code. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The presentation and the interim 
    report were started and completed almost exactly according to the plan, give 
    or take a couple of days. This was good for the programming aspect, although 
    I now know that I probably needed to spend more time on the interim report 
    as I didn’t go in to enough technical detail to show what I had been doing 
    for my project. This may have disadvantaged the progress that the project 
    should have been making at that time, but I wanted to stick to the timing as 
    much as I could.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The sixty percent functionality 
    by Christmas that was mentioned in the interim report was always a hopeful 
    estimate, but not too far from what I had. I feel that half of the project 
    was getting the animations and sound to work properly. This being the 
    essential core of the project I had two other parts to implement after this</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">When the Christmas holidays hit, 
    I felt that I had to differ from the project so that I could get some 
    revision done. Thinking back on it now, I probably would have kept going 
    with the project and simply stopped other aspects of what I was doing and 
    kept the revision up and the dissertation as well, but as I hadn’t included 
    anything in my original plan’s ghannt chart for the Christmas holidays, I 
    felt that this would be advantageous to my degree as a whole to take a break 
    from it. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The beginning of semester two was 
    largely spend revising again, with some minor reacquainting needed with my 
    project I got straight back in to work. Having almost finished the 
    ani9mation part of my project before the break I thought I would try and 
    implement a new part of the software. The next logical part of the system to 
    implement was to be the conversion panel. This was given the development 
    name of the CT Panel, and started life as a JFrame. I used much of the 
    following six to eight weeks developing the fundamental parts of this, as I 
    felt that without this part of the project being functional that I wouldn’t 
    stand a chance of getting a reasonable project in place.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The project has taken a few 
    breaks during the second semester due to the complexity of other 
    coursework’s that I have had to concentrate on.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">It took until the eight week of 
    the term to get this to a functional level, leaving the playback feature 
    that this is based on and the recording facility that would be based on the 
    playback feature. It was at this point that I was beginning to panic about 
    whether I could actually realistically finish the project. This then began 
    to work to my advantage, prompting me to make a start on the written work 
    allowed me to look back on the project and consider which parts I had to do 
    in order to make the software work. It gave me an abstract view of all the 
    parts that I had done already, forcing me to take a more positive view on 
    the programming aspect. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">With the end of the second 
    semester fast approaching, so I thought that before I started the playback 
    function I needed the CT panel and the Animator to be as one, before I 
    started to reference a load of methods that only existed in the other 
    classes. The merger between these was done into the animator class, so that 
    the applet was not being moved, and the previous JFrame that was used for 
    the CT panel, was implemented using the
    <span style="font-family: Courier New">extends JPanel</span> method. </font>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">When the end of the second 
    semester came about the merge had been done and the playback feature was 
    starting to take place, miles behind the proposed deadline of finishing the 
    programming aspect of the project by the fifth week of the semester. The 
    planning for this was in retrospect, ridiculous. There was no way that with 
    the volume of work that the third year has, I was ever going to have this 
    finished by the time the Ghannt chart had proposed. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">This left me a lot to do during 
    the Easter holidays, including finishing the playback, the images, scrolling 
    mechanisms, recording facilities and playing back the recorded notes. All of 
    this plus I had barely made a dent in the thirty-thousand words that I was 
    to write. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The first thing was to get the 
    playback finished, as I had started this it was a matter of getting it to 
    simply playback a couple of notes and then refine it when I had simple 
    functionality. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">This was to be followed by 
    implementing a recording facility to record what is actually played by the 
    user. When considering this, there were a lot of other things to consider, 
    like the buttons that have to be there for the recording to be started and 
    stopped and Booleans to show when it’s recording. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">Once complete the playback of the 
    recording could be done. This was harder than the recording as it would 
    simply play the notes with the same gap between them, without taking into 
    account the gaps that the user had left. This had to be remedied before the 
    images could be readdresses and then finally the scrolling mechanism could 
    be implemented. </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#FFFFFF">The scrolling mechanism would 
    then simply allow the user to view the notes that they had entered on a 
    small canvas by scrolling left or right when the user clicks on a button. 
    This should then be everything done on the system and then the written core 
    of the project could be concentrated on. </font></p>
